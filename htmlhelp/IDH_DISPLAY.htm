<h1>XLaunch Wizard</h1>
XLaunch is a wizard to make starting <a class="external" href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes"><img src="moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Xming</a> sessions easy.<br>
You can just simply start the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System"><img src="moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">X</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorg"><img src="moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">server</a> and run X clients latter by hand, but stating XDMCP or one X client automatically (via SSH if remote) is provided.
<h2><a name="1"></a>XLaunch Display settings</h2>
<h3><a name="2"></a>Display settings</h3>
This dialog sets the way Xming displays programs.
Select the display settings appropriate to your requirements.
<h4><a name="3"></a>Multiple windows</h4>
Start the integrated Microsoft Windows-based window manager which launches each top-level X window in its own Windows window. Use this mode if you don't understand the others. An exception is X windows of type '_net_wm_window_type_dock' which are rendered frameless and topmost (e.g. kde's kicker).
<h4><a name="4"></a>One window</h4>
The X server appears as a single Windows window and all X windows are contained within this window. This mode requires an external window manager. Typically this mode would be used for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDMCP"><img src="moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">XDMCP</a> login to a remote machine.<p>
The window size can be altered using the '-screen' parameter, for example enter
<pre>-screen 0 1024x768+125+100@1
</pre>
on the <a href="IDH_CLIPBOARD.htm" title="XLaunch Additional parameters">Additional parameters</a> page of this wizard for a 1024x768 window size, offset 125,100 as screen scr_num 0 on the 1st monitor (the default).
<h4><a name="5"></a>Fullscreen</h4>
This mode is like single window mode except that the X server window takes the full screen, covering completely the Windows desktop. This mode requires an external window manager.
<h4><a name="6"></a>One window without titlebar</h4>
This mode is like single window mode except that the X server window does not have a title bar or border, thus maximizing the amount of space available for X windows within the X server window. This mode requires an external window manager.
<h4><a name="7"></a>Display number</h4>
The display (or X Window server) number (default 0). The phrase 'display' is usually used to refer to a collection of physical monitors (and screens, see below) that share a common keyboard and mouse.<br>
On first glance the terms client and server in an X Window system appear backwards. Think of the server as the end providing the service. The service provided by X is access to the window, keyboard and mouse. On starting, the server creates a TCP end point and does a passive open on port 6000+<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is the display number. When a client is started on another host, it creates a TCP end point and performs an active open to port 6000+<i>n</i> on the server. Each client gets its own TCP connection to the server.
<h4><a name="8"></a>-screen scr_num @m</h4>
No specific entry method is provided in XLaunch for the screen number, enable different screens (scr_num) on different physical monitors (@m) via the '-screen' parameter.<br>
In X a multiple screen display may be implemented in several ways. There might be two physical monitors, linked to form a single display or two screens might be defined as different ways of using the same physical monitor. By default, windows are always placed on screen 0 (scr_num 0) but you can place a client window on screen 1 by specifying the screen number in the -display option when starting the client.
